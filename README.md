To begin with, draft the following information in your repositoryâ€™s README.md file:

A list of stakeholders with a role assigned for each (since no specialist knowledge is required, it is expected that each member covers each role at some point during the course of the project).

A personal profile for each member of the team. Include your name, where you are from, your education and work experience.
Draft a project charter.
Sabian Coomber from Gisborne, studying at EIT.
This information will later be migrated to the static website based on Github Pages as your project progresses.
